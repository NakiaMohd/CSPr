CS230 Laboratory Assignment (Tuesday and Wednesday)

(i) You are required to develop an PHP application that realises a version of the “Catch it, Check it, Change it” diary from the BBC’s Health Website:

http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/health/factsheets/catch.pdf

The blank diary sample is on page 3 of the document. Your submission should include two elements, one which collects and saves diary entries using a “Save Entry” button, and a second which displays the diary entries using a “Show Diary” button.

You should implement an PHP (embedded HTML) form element to collect diary entries. Your form and diary listing should be styled using some CSS, and the form should be validated using Javascript. Please note that this is A SERVER-SIDE assessment. The form, and form processor should be the same PHP application. We saw in lectures how to do this using the W3Schools examples.

You should store the submitted data in a MySQL database. We saw how to use PHP to write to, and read from, databases using the W3Schools examples.

(ii) You need to use your XMAPP installation for this assignment. You should first create a diary database table and ensure that you can write/read from the table manually before using PHP. Ensure you have read/write functionality before attempting to style (using CSS) text, or validating (using Javascript) your form, as the bulk of the marks will be awarded for the PHP form processing and database read/write.
